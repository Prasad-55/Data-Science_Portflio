# Problem Statement: 

In this project, as an NLP Engineer, My task initially is to preprocess the data using 
tTokenization and lLemmatization and then develop an understanding of the different 
components of the data by identifying various parts of speech and named entities present in 
the text. A Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes and syntactical 
structure of the sentencestext, further, I will perform the task of sentiment analysis on the 
data by classifying whether a movie review is positive or negative. 

## Movie Reviews Dataset: 

In this project, I am going to work on the ‘"Movie Reviews"’ data set that is also included in 
the NLTK Corpora. The dataset contains 1000 positive and 1000 negative processed reviews 
retrieved from the imdb.com website in the early 2000s by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee.
